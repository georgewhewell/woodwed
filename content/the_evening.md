Where to rest your head
--------------------------

If you are planning to stay over in London, there are plenty of great hotels in the vicinity, or the wider London area just a cab ride away. We will be staying at [The Kensington Hotel](https://www.doylecollection.com/hotels/the-kensington-hotel), but would also recommend the more reasonably priced [Doubletree by Hilton Kensington](http://crimsonhotels.com/dtkensington/), a mere drunken stumble away across the road.

Be sure to check online for deals before booking directly with either hotel!
