The evening
-----------------
Please join us for canap√©s and dancing to celebrate our wedding day!  The party will take place at  The Town House at The Kensington Hotel  11-13 Queens Gate  SW7 5LR The entrance is located on the corner of Manson Place. For directions click here.   Please arrive at 8.15pm  Bubbles and beer on arrival  Cash bar where to rest your head  If you are planning to stay over in London, there are plenty of great hotels in the vicinity, or the wider London area just a cab ride away. We will be staying at The Kensington Hotel, but would also recommend the more reasonably priced Regency Hotel, a mere drunken stumble away across the road.   Be sure to check online for deals before booking directly with either hotel!
