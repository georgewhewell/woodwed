Gifts
===============

We jumped the gun by moving in together two years ago, so this means that our flat is already stuffed with the things you’d traditionally expect to give as gifts. That’s why we’d like to ask instead if you’d make a donation on our behalf to The UN Refugee Agency. You can do so on the website [here](http://www.unhcr.org.uk/how-you-can-help/donate.html)

And for those of you who really can’t resist plying us with pressies, John Lewis vouchers are always a lovely thing.
